# HCPN: A Hybrid Convolutional Patch-based Network for Face Liveness Detection using Light Field Focal Stack

This python project is a sample of validation experiment for the article, including the LLFFSD light field database we used, HCPN model building, fitting and testing.
The utils includes data generateror and model structure, and in HCPN_test.py there is a simple example of model-train and test. The dataset of light field focla stack is in data folder.
